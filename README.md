# Cyberpunk-2077-Enter-Night-City

Dive into a dystopian future world with my new Cyberpunk 2077 inspired text-based game named "Cyberpunk : Enter Night City" built entirely in Java Swing!

It follows V from a nomad clan who wants to enter Night City to start his journey to become a night city legend. But be careful as in Night City we don't have happy endings.

Key features include:
• Multiple ways to reach the ending 
• Many enemy and weapon types
• Money and Health system
• Includes many locations from the game
• Personal narrative on the Cyberpunk game

I'm incredibly proud of how it turned out and excited to share it! Let me know if you would be interested in checking it out or discussing the development process.
